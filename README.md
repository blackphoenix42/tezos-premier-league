The idea is to develop a platform where players can indulge in PvP conflicts. Each player will bet XTZ before the match and have to score maximum points in the game. After the match whichever player scores more points will win the match. The winning player will get the XTZ and TPL points. These points will be used to unlock Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) which players can buy to showcase on their profile. Every game will increase/decrease a playerâ€™s tier and its position on the leaderboard.
